# SpotiFire
A custom implementation of the spotify client, serving both as a way for me to learn better javascript and as a way for me to implement custom features that i want in the spotify client.

If you are looking for an example of Authorisation code flow with pkce implementation for the spotify api, check out auth.js. It was very hard to find anything when i was googling for existing examples, so if you need an example then look no further.

The project will be marked archived, as I did not have time to continue it at the time. I may redo the project in python (a language im more familiar with), so potentially will release a more finalised version in the future :)
